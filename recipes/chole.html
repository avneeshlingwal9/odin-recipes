    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole refers to an Indian chickpeas curry, especially popular in northern parts of India. Chole is made with soaking
        chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) overnight and then cooking them with onions, tomatoes and spices to make
        this
        really flavorful curry. There are many ways in which you can make chole, and thereâ€™s no really right or wrong way of
        making them.</p>

    <h2> Steps
    
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak raw chickpeas overnight in enough water to cover them. I soaked 2 cups of raw chickpeas and in the morning
            I had
            around 5 cups of it. Drain the water in which the chickpeas were soaked.</li>
        <li>
            Transfer the chickpeas to a stovetop pressure cooker and add the following:
            <ul>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li> 5 green cardamom pods</li>
                <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>2 black tea bags (these are added to give chole a darker color, skip if you donâ€™t care about the color).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add around 5 cups of water and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>Stir and close the lid of the pressure cooker. Pressure cook at high heat for 1 to 2 whistles. After that, lower
            the
            heat to medium and let the chickpeas cook for another 10 to 12 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let the
            pressure
            release naturally.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooker from heat and allow it to cool down. Once the steam is gone, open the cooker and check the
            chickpeas.
            You should be able to press them easily with your fingers. If not, close the cooker and cook for 2 more
            whistles. Remove
            the tea bags from the cooker and also remove the bay leaves and cinnamon stick using a pair of tongs. Set this
            aside and
            start working on the masala.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot or kadai on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 to 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of oil to it. Then add 2 whole cloves
            and 3/4
            cup grated onions to the pot.</li>
        <li>Fry the onions until the raw smell goes away and they are light golden brown in color, this takes around 7 to 8
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 teaspoons of ginger garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes until the raw smell goes away.</li>
        <li>Now, add 2 & 1/2 cups of tomato puree (from 4 medium tomatoes/around 435 grams) and stir.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook the tomatoes for around 15 minutes on medium-low heat, stir every 2 to 3 minutes in
            between. This
            step in my opinion is very important. The tomatoes need to be cooked really well until the raw smell goes away
            completely. So have patience and let them cook for around 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the spices:
            <ul>
                <li>3 teaspoons chole masala</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (use Kashmiri red chili powder for less heat)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li>and 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste, remember we already added 1 teaspoon salt while boiling the
                    chickpeas).</li>
    
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
