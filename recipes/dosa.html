    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dosa also called as Dosai (in Tamil language) is a famous and popular South Indian breakfast or snack in India as well
    in the rest of the world. Dosa are basically crispy or soft crepes made with ground and fermented lentil and rice
    batter.</p>
    <p>
        To make the batter, first the lentils and rice are soaked in water for 4 to 5 hours. They are then ground separately to
        a fine consistency.
        
        Then both the lentil batter and the rice batter are mixed with salt in a wide bowl or pan. This batter is then allowed
        to ferment overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.
